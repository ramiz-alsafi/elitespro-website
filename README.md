## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Replace placeholder Google Analytics ID (`GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`) in all HTML files with your actual tracking ID.

3. Upload all files and folders to your web hosting provider.

4. Ensure the `assets/`, `css/`, and `js/` folders are in the root alongside the HTML files.

5. Open `index.html` in your browser to verify the website is working.

## Customization

- Update text content inside HTML files to reflect your current offerings and company details.
- Add or replace images in the `assets/` folder.
- Modify `css/style.css` for styling changes.
- Update or expand the JavaScript in `js/scripts.js` as needed.

## Contact Form Notes

- The contact pages use a `mailto:` link which opens the user’s default email client.
- To handle contact submissions on the server side, you will need to implement a backend email handler or use third-party services.
